The top secret of being physically fit is adopting a healthy lifestyle. A healthy lifestyle includes regular exercise, a healthy diet, taking good care of self, healthy sleep habits, and having a physically active daily routine.

		All of these things are serious impediments to widest-spread human flourishing, and yet these are the main areas of economic growth.</p> <p> It doesn’t matter if you’re on the left or the right, all our best minds and the vast majority of investment capital is being poured into apps, web platforms, AI, crony corporatism, hyper-cities, and the digital realm.</p>


		<p>Homo sapiens are a biological species — so why are powerful private interests building an anti-human digital technocracy for the benefit of the few?</p>

		<p>Because human beings are desperately selfish. Once we secure the eight essentials, we don’t start helping others do the same.</p> <p> Instead, we try to pad our lead. We move from essentials to comfort to antisocial luxury.</p> <p> We get into fine art, fine dining, high fashion, predatory corporatism.</p> <p> Instead of building institutions that deliver the eight elements sustainably, we sell whatever’s most profitable.</p>

		<p>Billionaires especially don’t care if the rest of the world suffers, because they already have healthy food, sufficient shelter, and so forth.</p> <p> As long as it doesn’t affect them, they’ll focus on whatever’s most personally profitable.</p>

		<p>Just look at market valuations. It’s absolutely absurd to think that Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Facebook are legitimately more “valuable” than all the farmland in America.</p> <p> We can all happily survive without those four companies, but we’d be doomed without the latter.</p>

	       <p>	We’ve lost the script on what’s actually valuable, and what actually creates human flourishing.</p>
